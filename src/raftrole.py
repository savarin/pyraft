"""
Codification of roles and state attributes. In other words, state attributes
either need to be initialized or reset on role changes; the enumeration here
acts as constraints.


Rules for Servers section in Figure 2 of Raft paper:

All Servers:
- If RPC request or response contains term T > currentTerm: set currentTerm = T,
  convert to follower (ยง5.1)

Followers (ยง5.2):
- If election timeout elapses without receiving AppendEntries RPC from current
  leader or granting vote to candidate: convert to candidate

Candidates (ยง5.2):
- On conversion to candidate, start election:
  - Increment currentTerm
  - Vote for self
  - Reset election timer
  - Send RequestVote RPCs to all other servers
- If votes received from majority of servers: become leader
- If AppendEntries RPC received from new leader: convert to follower
